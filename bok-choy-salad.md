## Sauce

Combine `3/4 Cup Vegetable Oil`, `1/4 Cup Red Wine Vinegar`, `1/2 Cup Sugar` and `2 Tablespoon Soy Sauce`. Shake well to mix.

> Note: if sugar does not desolve heating shortly (for example 20 seconds in a microwave) can help.

Sauce may be saved temporarily (~4 days), but once applied to salad should be served immediately. A canning jar works well for this.

## Toppings

Melt `1/2 Cup Butter` in skillet and mix in `2 Tablespoon Sugar`. Crush `2 pkgs of ramen noodles` and mix  `2 pkgs of ramen noodles` and `1/2 Cup Sesame Seed` into skillet. Cook until brown (~5 Mins). While cooking add `3 oz sliced Almonds` to avoid overcooking them. Allow to cool.

## Salad

Combine `Bok Choy` and `Green Onions`.

To Serve toss Sauce, Toppings and Salad immediately prior to serving.
